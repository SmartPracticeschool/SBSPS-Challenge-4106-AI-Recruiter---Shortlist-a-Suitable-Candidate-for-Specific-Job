AI for recruiting is an emerging category of HR technology designed to reduce — or even remove — time-consuming activities like manually screening resumes.
Screening resumes efficiently and time-effectively still remains the biggest challenge in talent acquisition: 52% of talent acquisition leaders say the hardest part of recruitment is identifying the right candidates from a large applicant pool.
According to a survey of talent acquisition leaders, 56% say their hiring volume will increase this year, but 66% of recruiting teams will either stay the same size or contract.

3.2 Hardware / Software Design: -
For this project, I designed a chatbot, in that a candidate have to answer several questions . I created two rounds for Test. If the total score is less than 6 then he/she is not qualified else he/she is qualified.
 4 Experimental Analysis: -
We test the chatbot several times if you enter wrong thing it shows error.

5 Result: - 
As a result, it works fine. If we deployed it, it can success since after coronavirus pandemic end, many company hires employees so we can offer that companies our chatbot from which they can hire faster.

7 Conclusion: - 
Artificial Intelligence is changing the game in a number of industries, including recruiting. If you’re not adding AI into your recruiting process, or at least reading up on the possibilities, you’re definitely missing out.   There are a number of benefits to adding AI to your recruitment process. As you begin to test new processes or systems, you can learn more about what you and your candidates are looking for during the job hunt. With the right tools, software, and programs, you can develop an automated process that improves the quality of your candidates and their application experience.  

8 Future Scope: - 
While AI is reported to have a major impact on the workforce, recruiters will likely be safe. There are many efficiencies hiring software offers but the benefits are more of automated workflows and not necessarily computerized decision making.
